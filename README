pokehack.

Pokemon Generation 3 Save state editor.

GUI currently supports viewing first pokemon in party.
The console application supports editing any data from any pokemon, but requires editing pkc3.c and recompiling.

= How to Use =

== GUI ==
=== Compile ===
>cd src
>make release
=== Run ===
Open pokehack.exe in the release subdirectory. File > Open to select a save state.

NOTES:
-Save states need to be decompressed before they can be read (gzipped originally by VBA)
-Does not currently support editing pokemon
-Does not currently support viewing any pokemon besides the first in your belt
-Has been tested only on Pokemon FireRed

== Console ==
First edit pkc3.c to have it change any attribute of the pokemon you want
=== Compile ===
[In root repo directory ]
>make
=== Run ===
pokehack.exe <path/to/savestate>

NOTES:
-Save states need to be decompressed before they can be read (gzipped originally by VBA)
-Overwrites the save state, so make sure you make a backup first. Must be recompressed to be used in VBA
-Does not currently support viewing any pokemon besides the first in your belt
-Has been tested only on Pokemon FireRed

= Wish List =
-Switch through pokemon
-Species list
-Attack list
-Held item list
-Auto game detection
 -Try different start addresses? (Requires testing each game)
 -Scan for pokemon based on name/order? (Requires extra input from user)
 -Scan for consecutive pokemon_t looking data, based on current HP / max HP perhaps? (more constraints to user)
-'Shiny' button
 -Changes personality value and/or original trainer id to set pokemon to shiny state.
  -Changing personality changes the gender and the nature.
  -Changing the trainer ID is easier to detect (should change trainer name, too) and makes pokemon gain extra experience.
